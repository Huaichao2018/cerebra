# Summary

This is a proof of concept integration between a GitHub [@haplocaller] repo and figshare [@freebayes] in an effort to get a DOI for a GitHub repository. When a repository is tagged for release on GitHub, Fidgit [@bwa] will import the release into figshare thus giving the code bundle a DOI. In a somewhat meta fashion, Fidgit is publishing itself to figshare with DOI
